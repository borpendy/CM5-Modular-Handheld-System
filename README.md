# CM5-Modular-Handheld-System
Experimental modular handheld architecture, for cheaper rapid prototyping

This will take a while to do, basically consists of a standard motherboard design + multiple different controller daughterboards

Current plan for daughterboards = DSpi 2, Dual 7 inch handheld, Controller sized PC (HDMI out only), Laptop size cyberdeck (TBD form factor)

Ok heres the board files:
